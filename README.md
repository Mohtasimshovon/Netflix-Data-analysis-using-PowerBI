I used a publicly available dataset of Netflix, where there are some significant attributes like Content type, Runtime, Release year, Genre, Production country, and IMDB score. The dataset consists of two tables with a common key, by which I joined both tables to extract important pieces of information. By using these attributes, I can find the average IMDb ranking of each content, the highest viewing contents in terms of genres, and the geographically distributed runtime of different contents. I used Power BI, which is one of the leading business intelligence tools for analyzing this dataset and finding important insights from this. The area of application is to analyze customer preference, analyze trends of generating content over time, and content distribution in terms of genre, release year & title, and the overall proportion of the content, which will give us an idea about the genre popularity year by year.
